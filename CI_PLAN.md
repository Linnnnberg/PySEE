# CI/CD Plan for PySEE

This document outlines the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment plan for PySEE, designed for efficient multi-developer collaboration.

## Overview

Our CI/CD strategy focuses on:
- **Automated testing** on multiple Python versions
- **Code quality checks** (linting, formatting, type checking)
- **Automated releases** with proper versioning
- **Clear development workflow** for contributors
- **Scientific-friendly pre-commit hooks** optimized for bioinformatics workflows

## CI/CD Pipeline

### 1. Continuous Integration (CI)

#### Trigger Events
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main` or `develop` branches

#### CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
```yaml
Jobs:
1. Test (Matrix: Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11)
   - Install dependencies
   - Run linting (flake8, black, mypy)
   - Run tests (pytest)
   - Test example scripts

2. Build
   - Build package
   - Check package integrity
   - Upload build artifacts
```

#### Quality Gates
- ✅ All tests must pass
- ✅ Code must pass linting checks
- ✅ Code must be properly formatted
- ✅ Type checking must pass
- ✅ Package must build successfully

### 2. Release Workflow

#### Trigger Events
- Git tags matching `v*` pattern (e.g., `v0.2.0`)

#### Release Process (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
1. Build package
2. Check package integrity
3. Create GitHub release
4. Upload release assets

## Pre-commit Hooks Optimization

### Scientific-Friendly Configuration
Our pre-commit configuration is specifically optimized for scientific bioinformatics tools:

#### **Essential Checks (Always Enabled)**
- **Black Formatting**: 100-character lines (longer for scientific code)
- **Trailing Whitespace**: Clean version control
- **End-of-file Fixer**: POSIX compliance
- **YAML Validation**: CI/CD integrity
- **Merge Conflict Detection**: Prevents broken code
- **Debug Statement Detection**: Production quality

#### **Scientific-Optimized Checks**
- **Flake8**: Lenient rules for scientific naming patterns
  - Ignores: E203, W503, E501, F401 (common in scientific code)
  - 100-character line limit
  - Higher complexity threshold (15)
- **MyPy**: Simplified type checking
  - Ignores missing imports (common with scientific libraries)
  - Warns instead of fails on type issues
  - Disables strict type requirements
- **Large Files**: 10MB limit (allows scientific datasets)

#### **Benefits for Scientific Development**
- ✅ **Faster Development**: Less friction during coding
- ✅ **Scientific-Friendly**: Accommodates scientific naming and patterns
- ✅ **Better Collaboration**: Easier for researchers to contribute
- ✅ **Maintained Quality**: Still catches important issues
- ✅ **Reliable Setup**: No complex dependency issues

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
```
main (production)
├── develop (integration)
├── feature/new-panel
├── feature/heatmap-support
├── bugfix/selection-bug
└── hotfix/critical-fix
```

### Workflow Steps
1. **Create feature branch** from `develop`
2. **Make changes** with proper testing
3. **Run local checks** before pushing
4. **Create pull request** to `develop`
5. **Code review** and CI checks
6. **Merge to develop** after approval
7. **Merge to main** for releases

### Local Development Setup
```bash
# Install development dependencies
make install-dev

# Setup pre-commit hooks
make setup-pre-commit

# Run local CI checks
make ci

# Format code
make format
```

## Quality Assurance

### Automated Checks
- **Code Formatting**: Black formatter
- **Linting**: Flake8 with custom rules
- **Type Checking**: MyPy with strict settings
- **Testing**: Pytest with coverage
- **Package Building**: Setuptools build

### Manual Checks
- **Code Review**: At least one maintainer approval
- **Documentation**: Updated for user-facing changes
- **Breaking Changes**: Clearly documented

## Release Management

### Version Strategy
- **Semantic Versioning**: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
- **Release Tags**: `v0.2.0`, `v0.2.1`, etc.
- **Changelog**: Updated for each release

### Release Process
1. Update version in `setup.py` and `pysee/__init__.py`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md`
3. Create and push git tag
4. GitHub Actions creates release automatically

## Multi-Developer Collaboration

### Communication
- **Issues**: Bug reports and feature requests
- **Pull Requests**: Code changes with templates
- **Discussions**: General questions and ideas
- **Code Review**: Constructive feedback

### Standards
- **Coding Style**: PEP 8 + Black formatting
- **Documentation**: Google-style docstrings
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Commits**: Clear, descriptive messages

### Tools
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automatic code formatting
- **Makefile**: Common development tasks
- **Templates**: PR and issue templates
- **CI/CD**: Automated quality checks

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### CI Health
- Monitor CI build times
- Track test coverage
- Review failed builds
- Update dependencies regularly

### Release Health
- Monitor release downloads
- Track issue reports
- Review user feedback
- Plan future releases

## Getting Started for Contributors

### First Time Setup
```bash
# Fork and clone repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PySEE.git
cd PySEE

# Setup development environment
make install-dev
make setup-pre-commit

# Run tests to verify setup
make test
```

### Making Changes
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature

# Make changes and test
make ci

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Add: your feature description"
git push origin feature/your-feature

# Create pull request via GitHub
```

### Code Review Process
1. **Automated Checks**: CI must pass
2. **Manual Review**: At least one maintainer
3. **Address Feedback**: Update code as needed
4. **Final Approval**: Maintainer merges

## Benefits
